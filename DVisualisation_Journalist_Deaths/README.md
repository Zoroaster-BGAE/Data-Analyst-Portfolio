# Data Foundations Assignment

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Data Foundations assignment
completed during my MSc program. 

The assignment focused on data selection, cleaning, legal
considerations, structured and semi-structured data, data modeling, and implementation. 

For the project I used the R programming language and some SQL databases.
